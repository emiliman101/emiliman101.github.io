    <h1>Artist Statement for CLICK HER</h1>
      <p>My piece <em>Fear and Growth.</em> is a visual expression of my own fear to be vulnerable and brave.
        Many of my life challenges were never met. Instead of facing them, I often found myself cowering in fear and 
        choosing a safer option. I chose a safe job washing dishes for a long time, because it worked for me even against my disgust and 
        hatred of the profession of scrubbing left over food from freshman's plates. I chose not to ask a girl that I liked 
        out or even once was able to hold a conversation longer then a sentence in length. I chose to not try to ace my test for fear that 
        If I tried and failed I would be a phony for calling myself intelligent. Instead of actually testing my limits I 
        took shelter in telling myself I had none, and never gave myself proof to disable those thoughts. Until I met someone who forced me 
        to face my fear, because for once it wasn't all about how I felt. The piece begins with a clip of a gentleman saying, "There
        Are No Alligator's in the Lake." In the background though the train noise seems to be of a train that crashes. When 
        the train crashes a girl appears, mysterious as her hair is all we see. This is supposed to convey life going as planned, there are no alligators
        in the lake to fear of. Yet, there is, and like the train, I was helpless but to fall in love, unable to divert path.
        I am not calling the girl an alligator as a parallel for death, but one of an everlasting forceful grip of passion an alligator 
        would have on prey. The next sequence is a series of clouds and water. Both apart of the cycle for natural water movement on earth,
        the water crashes like the train would have, bashing against a sudden wall, my safe space, invaded. She holds this power in her gaze.
        I am helpless, I can't have helped but to wonder, how did I get here? The clouds move and a bird flies by. What comes first the cloud or
        water, water, but the cloud takes and gives water to the land, it is water escaping earth, and water destined to fall, afraid it stands above the mountains.
        I was afraid, why could I not say hello, but I did. I said hello and now there I was, vulnerable, and out for rejection.
        The clouds felt to have gone back, the water retracting as if the waves on the beach has pulled back into the ocean, my fears
         rolled back and my flood of insecurities pulled back, perhaps to come again, but now I know I will be okay if they so choose to hit shore again.
        The last sequence is a reflection. I am to grow and experience fear for the rest of my life. I construct a facade of importance that keeps me 
        from truly expressing who I am. In learning to love in an open way, I have learned that I was always enough and didn't have anything to 
        fear except not trying. A cliche lifestyle we all state to know, but rarely practice. I will always be the best me I can be. I do not mean anything
        unless I try, and to fail to the grow, to break the drawn facade of true meaningless existence.
